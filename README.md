# sorting-algorithms-visualizer-java
This is a simple java .classpath project that visualizes sorting algorithms. 

Algorithms used: 
ðŸ”¶ Quick Sort
ðŸ”¶ Bubble Sort
ðŸ”¶ Heap Sort
ðŸ”¶ Merge Sort
ðŸ”¶ Insertion Sort
ðŸ”¶ Selection Sort
ðŸ”¶ Shell Sort
GUI : Java AWT

The user starts the program either through the .jar file or through the Eclipse IDE. Now the user interface opens, which shows the following:

On the left side, there are four checkboxes, which are checked by default.
Below each checkbox, there is a dropdown menu that allows the user to select the algorithm to be displayed.
Below that, there is a slider that determines the speed at which the algorithms run.
The user can choose the size of the array to be sorted through an input field.
At the bottom, there are the buttons "Start", "Stop", and "New".
On the right side, there are four fields, each displaying a visualization of an algorithm. The array to be sorted is represented by vertical bars, which correspond to the values in the array.
Each field displays the name of the selected algorithm, the size of the array, the runtime, and the adjusted runtime (the actual runtime of the algorithm without interruptions for visualization).
The user has the option to activate or deactivate the fields using the checkboxes.
The dropdown menus allow the user to select the sorting algorithms to be displayed.
When the user clicks the "Start" button, the algorithms start sorting.
Clicking the "Stop" button interrupts the algorithm. If the "Start" button is clicked again, the algorithm resumes from where it was interrupted.
The user can fill a sorted array with new random values by clicking the "New" button.
